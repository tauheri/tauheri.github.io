<span style="color:blue">About me</span>
======
Hey there! I'm Masoumeh, a guy who's embarked on a journey fueled by curiosity and a desire for exploration. Coding is my ultimate passion, and I'm always up for challenging myself and delving into new experiences. Outside of that, I love immersing myself in music; specifically, I'm a big fan of rap and rock. Connecting with new people and making friends is something I thrive on, so feel free to reach out if you're up for a chat!

<span style="color:blue">Work and Study</span>
======
In 2022, I successfully earned my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from [Babol Noshirvani University of Technology](https://nit.ac.ir/en). For the past two years, I've been engaged as a part-time research assistant in the Computational Intelligence Laboratory, under the guidance of [Dr. Hesam Omranpour](https://web.nit.ac.ir/~h.omranpour/index.html?LANG=En). My areas of specialization encompass Algorithm design, Deep learning, Data mining, and Computer vision, with a particular focus on medical image analysis. Recently, I've developed a streamlined method for generating features to detect breast cancer. This effort resulted in a published [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105382) featured in the Biomedical Signal Processing and Control journal. 
In addition to these pursuits, I've been engaged as a Python developer at Roshan, an AI company, for approximately one year. My central role revolves around the creation and implementation of RESTful APIs, which serve to facilitate smooth interaction between frontend interfaces and AI models. This endeavor is aimed at elevating the user experience.

======
- My final project ranked first among bachelor projects across all departments at Babol Noshirvani University of Technology.
- Obtaining a research grant (No P/M/1110) resulted in the publication of my most recent [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105382) in the Biomedical Signal Processing and Control journal.
