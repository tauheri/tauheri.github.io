<span style="color:blue">About me</span>
======
Hey there! I'm Masoumeh, though most know me as Termeh. I'm a guy who's embarked on a journey fueled by curiosity and a desire for exploration. Coding is my ultimate passion, and I'm always up for challenging myself and delving into new experiences. Outside of that, I love immersing myself in music; specifically, I'm a big fan of rap and rock. Connecting with new people and making friends is something I thrive on, so feel free to reach out if you're up for a chat!

<span style="color:blue">Work and Study</span>
======
In 2022, I successfully earned my bachelor's degree in computer software engineering from Noshirvani University of Technology. For the past two years, I've been engaged as a part-time research assistant in the Computational Intelligence Laboratory, under the guidance of Dr. Omranpour. My areas of specialization encompass Algorithm design, Deep learning, Data mining, and Computer vision, with a particular focus on medical image analysis. Currently, I've developed a streamlined method for generating features to detect breast cancer. This effort resulted in a published paper featured in the Biomedical Signal Processing and Control journal.

======
- My final project ranked first among bachelor projects across all departments at Noshirvani University of Technology.
- Obtaining a research grant (No P/M/1110) resulted in the publication of my most recent [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105382) in the Biomedical Signal Processing and Control journal.
