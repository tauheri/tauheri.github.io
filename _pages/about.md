I am an AI researcher with a background spanning 2 years in the realm of computer vision, specializing prominently in the analysis of medical images. Recently, my work reached a significant milestone as I successfully published a
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105382) in the Biomedical Signal Processing and Control journal. This publication introduces a novel feature generator that amplifies the efficacy of features derived from deep neural networks.

My journey into the world of AI commenced during my academic pursuit, specifically through a data mining course. This exposure led me to delve into the intricacies of this domain, prompting me to undertake projects focused on classification and regression using conventional AI models.

Concurrently, I have been actively engaged as a Python developer at Roshan, an AI company. In this role, I've been instrumental in the design and implementation of RESTful APIs, facilitating seamless communication between frontend interfaces and AI models. This endeavor significantly enriched the user experience. Additionally, my involvement extended to augmenting model performance. I undertook the design of preprocessing algorithms tailored to enhance the performance of text-processing models.

My ardor for AI, particularly in the context of computer vision and medical image analysis, is fervent. I continually seek opportunities to amass further proficiency and acumen in this domain, with the ultimate aim of amplifying my expertise and insights.
